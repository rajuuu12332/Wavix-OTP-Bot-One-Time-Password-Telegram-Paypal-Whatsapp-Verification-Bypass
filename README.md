## Question&Answer
<details>
<summary>How OTP Bots Work</summary>
OTP bots use social engineering to trick a consumer into sharing sensitive information about digital accounts. Attackers use them for international calling with multiple call scripts in several types of voice accents.

While attempting to log into a potential victim’s digital banking account, the attacker feeds the OTP bot with the consumer’s phone number and the name of the bank. These inputs prompt the OTP bot to initiate a call to the victim and dupe them into divulging the 2FA code (OTP or token), account PIN, and other personally identifiable information. For instance, an OTP bot would call consumers about a suspected unauthorized activity on their bank accounts, urging them to promptly enter the OTPs generated on their mobile phone’s app for their account security. These bots create panic and a sense of urgency among consumers to act. Moreover, they take advantage of consumers being habitual of using codes to authenticate while speaking to customer service executives. As soon as the consumers enter the codes, attackers can see them in real-time on the service provider’s website. They can then use these codes to complete the unauthorized transactions.

<summary>What can i do with it?</summary>
The bots that enable attackers to extract one-time passwords from consumers without human-intervention are commonly known as OTP bots. Attackers use these programmed bots to call up unsuspecting consumers and trick them into divulging their two-factor authentication codes. They then use these codes to authenticate and complete unauthorized transactions from compromised accounts.
